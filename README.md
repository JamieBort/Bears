Activity: Bears! - Practice with HTML - Pair Programming

During this activity, work with your partner to convert the provided text into valid HTML pages. Evaluate the text files and review the screenshots of all three pages. Discuss how best to markup the elements to create a valid HTML document.

Work closely together to make decisions about how you'll mark up the HTML, but be sure to write your own code. Stop frequently to compare and contrast good approaches to coding the HTML pages.

At the end of this assignment, you should have three pages linked together by navigation. Take a look at the screen shots and the source text files.

Getting Started  
Read the enclosed README.md file for more details.

This activity includes starter files for the three HTML pages, index.html, stats.html, and species.html. Download the following source folder and unpack it. In the unzipped folder, you will find the starter files, assets, and completed code. Do not look at the solution code until both of you have marked up the HTML pages! This is a group project, help one another as much as needed.

Your role as a student

Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
